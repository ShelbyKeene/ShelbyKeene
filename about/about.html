        <h3> Hi there...</h3>
        <h3 class="name"> My name is <span>Shelby Keene</span></h3>
        <!--<h3>I am a <span class="typing-text" id="typing-text">Web Developer</span></h3>-->
        <p>
        I feel incredibly fortunate to have grown up in the lively and artistic community of New Orleans, 
        which instilled in me a deep love and appreciation for the power of creativity. As a child from 
        south Louisiana, I was surrounded by a culture that celebrated self-expression and individuality, 
        and it was through this environment that I discovered my own passion for art, drawing, and 
        photography. This creative drive has translated into a
        passion for web design, which allows me to bring my ideas to life in a tangible way. 
        With an understanding of both data and software, I am uniquely positioned to create stunning,
        intuitive, and functional websites that engage users and drive results. 
        With my technical expertise and artistic sensibility combined, I can produce web designs 
        that are both visually stunning and user-friendly; optimizing the user experience while delivering 
        measurable business value. Whether developing custom software solutions or analyzing complex 
        data sets, I bring a unique perspective and creative energy to every project. </p>
